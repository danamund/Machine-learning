In this project, I worked on a classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a Titanic passenger survived or not.
The dataset includes real information like age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more.
Using this data, we trained different machine learning models and compared their performance.
Along the way, we handled missing values, transformed features, and used cross-validation to find the best model.
